                            It is about getting values between 2 already existing points by providing a value normally called 't' where it is between 0 - 1. As 't' represents the 
                            progress from the first value to the second value

                            <p>Values can be interpolated differently depending on the math behind it. For example, some are interpolated linearly, while others are interpolated

                            <p>Interpolation can also differ from methods in terms of the number of values used! This happens when interpolation is done in <strong>2D</strong> instead of
                                <strong>1D</strong>. Meaning to say 2D interpolation methods such as bi-linear will require 4 values instead of 1!
                                Here is an example of a simple bi-linear interpolation
